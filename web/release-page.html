</h1>

<p>
This is the release page for probcomp-stack-0.2 from the 
<a href="http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/"
>MIT Probabilistic Computing Project</a>.

The release is a stand-alone 
<a href="https://www.docker.com/">docker</a> image that includes a
running
<a href="https://jupyter.org/">jupyter notebook server</a> through which the
probcomp software and documentation can be accessed.
</p>

<p>
The probcomp stack contains three probabilistic programming platforms:
</p>

<ol>
<li> The <a href="http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/bayesdb/doc/index.html">bayeslite</a>
  implementation of BayesDB, a platform for
  AI-assisted data science. 
  (<a href="https://github.com/probcomp/bayeslite">github</a>)
</li>

<li> The <a href="http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/venture/">venturelite</a> implementation of 
  Venture, an interactive
  probabilistic reasoning platform that has been used for teaching
  probabilistic modeling and inference and for rapid prototyping in
  computer vision, data science, and robotics. </li>

<li> A pre-alpha version of Gen.jl, a Julia implementation of Gen, a
  probabilistic meta-programming platform and high-performance run-time
  system suitable for production engineering in probabilistic
  robotics. (no documentation is available at this time)</li>
</ol>

<p>
Key capabilities of these platforms can be accessed via the notebooks included with this release.
</p>

<p>
Version 0.2 of the probcomp stack was created on 18 July 2017.
</p>

<h2>
Before you start
</h2>

<p>
This is research software.  It is certain to contain flaws.  No warranty of any kind
is implied by this release.  Use it at your own risk.
</p>

<p>
The installation requires some level of technical ability,
specifically the ability to use the command line, and to install
prerequisite software if required.
</p>

<h3>Hardware requirements</h3>

<p>
The notebooks in this release have successfully executed with the
following hardware configuration, with acceptable performance:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> 60G RAM </li>
  <li> 32 CPU cores </li>
  <li> 2.5 Gbyte available disk space </li>
</ul>

<p>
Running with much less than this may lead to heavy load, long
delays, and/or crashes. Actual application demands vary depending on the
particulars of the data set, both on its size and on the data itself.
</p>

<p>
We assume that you are using a workstation possessing the recommended
resources via the workstation's monitor and keyboard.  Client/server
configurations are possible for this software with additional
setup, but methods vary by operating system.  We have not prepared
documentation for client/server configurations.
</p>

<p>
[NOTE: It is JAR's feeling that very few people will have a hefty
workstation with a head; indeed I have personally never seen such a thing.  They are
much more likely to have a hefty server and an ordinary laptop or desktop.  This
is why I feel compelled to say <i>something</i> about client/server
configuration: If we do not acknowledge the possibility, then it will sound
as if a same-computer configuration is <i>required</i> when it is not,
and we will immediately decimate the potential user base.]

<p>
[CONTINUED: Mentioning 'ssh tunnel' could be a useful hint
for some portion of the audience (not all of it), but I understand
that we're not supposed to mention ssh for some reason?  There are
other access options (e.g. https) but we don't have time before Wednesday to
implement any hooks or features that would make this setup easy and
documentable.  I see the two constraints "no new implementation work now" and
"do not mention ssh" as forcing the above weasel-wording.]

<h3>Software prerequisites</h3>

<p>
probcomp-stack-0.2 has been tested on ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS, but we
anticipate that it will run on any operating system that supports
<a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>, such as most GNU/Linux
variants, Mac OS X, and 
<a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/#what-to-know-before-you-install"
>64-bit Windows 10</a>.
</p>

<p>
probcomp-stack-0.2 requires Docker version 1.6 or later.
</p>

<h2>Download and installation</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Download and save <a href="https://probcomp-1.csail.mit.edu/probcomp-stack/probcomp-stack-full-0.2.tar.gz"
       >the probcomp-stack-0.2 distribution</a> (370 MB).</p>

    <p>Optional: To check the integrity of the download, verify that the SHA256
checksum is 145afeb0ee0cfadbe874e301c4117294ab7055c737eeab0f18135f35aedf2f98.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      At the command line, navigate to the directory containing
      <code>probcomp-stack-full-0.2.tar.gz</code>.
    </p>
  <li>
    <p>
      Tell docker about the probcomp-stack container as follows:</p>

    <pre><code> $ docker load --input probcomp-stack-full-0.2.tar.gz</code></pre>
  </li>

</ol>

<h2>How to run</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
      At the command line, navigate to the directory containing
      <code>probcomp-stack-full-0.2.tar</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Start the Docker container as follows:</p>

    <pre><code> $ docker run --rm --publish 127.0.0.1:8080:8080/tcp \
     probcomp/stack-release:0.2</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a web browser, visit the location 
    <a href="http://localhost:8080/"><code>http://localhost:8080/</code></a></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
In the unlikely event that port 8080 is unavailable on your machine, feel free to choose a
different port.
</p>
